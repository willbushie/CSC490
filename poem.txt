come
away
come
away
death
and
in
sad
cypres
let
me
be
laid
fly
away
fly
away
breath
i
am
slain
by
a
fair
cruel
maid
my
shroud
of
white
stuck
all
with
yew
o
prepare
it
my
part
of
death
no
one
so
true
did
share
it
not
a
flower
not
a
flower
sweet
on
my
black
coffin
let
there
be
strown
not
a
friend
not
a
friend
greet
my
poor
corse
where
my
bones
shall
be
thrown
a
thousand
thousand
sighs
to
save
lay
me
o
where
sad
true
lover
never
find
my
grave
to
weep
there
